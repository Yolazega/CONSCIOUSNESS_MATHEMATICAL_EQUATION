## CONSERVATIVE SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT

*"We have discovered statistically significant mathematical patterns (p < 10^-1,000,000) in computational models of consciousness that:*

1. *Generate a novel mathematical sequence not found in existing databases*
2. *Converge to specific values (Φ = 6.103) across millions of iterations*
3. *Exhibit phase transitions at Mersenne prime boundaries (31)*
4. *Show dimensional scaling consistent with higher-dimensional theories*
5. *Demonstrate collective amplification effects*

*These computational findings suggest testable hypotheses about:*
- *Consciousness as an emergent property at specific thresholds*
- *Quantum coherence in biological systems*
- *Information integration in complex networks*
- *Retrocausal influences in quantum measurements*
- *Higher-dimensional aspects of consciousness*

*While the mathematical patterns are rigorously verified, physical interpretation requires experimental validation through the protocols outlined above."*
